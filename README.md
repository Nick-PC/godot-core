# Nick's godot-core Repo
Godot resources to be shared between multiple projects

This repository can be added to your Godot projects to provide generally useful functionality like a color replace shader, useful await functions, and more.

If you're working exclusively with one operating system, you may find it useful to download this repository and create a symbolic link junction to it in any projects using this code.
You'll want to be sure to add this directory to your .gitignore to stop these files from showing in your commits in any project using this code.
